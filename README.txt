An improved game for the Minetest game engine [minetest_tng]
============================================================

To use this game with Minetest, insert this repository as
  /games/minetest_next
in the Minetest Engine.

The Minetest engine can be found in:
	https://github.com/minetest/minetest/

Introduction
------------
Since I (LNJ / LNJplus) read that BlockMen leaves us, I decided to fork and continue BlockMen's really nice work!
Of course I would really like to hear your ideas and suggestions!
I changed the title of the game to Minetest: The NeXt Gameration. :D

My plans:
    - many new plants and trees
    - CME (Creatures Mob Engine) that means some mobs
    - some nice decorations like pictures, furniture
    - many new cooking recipes
    - hunger
